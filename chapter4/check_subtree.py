"""Solution to 4.10 Check Subtree.

`T1` and `T2` are two very large binary trees, with `T1` much bigger
than `T2`. Create an algorithm to determine if `T2` is a subtree of
`T1`.

A tree `T2` is a subtree of `T1` if there exists a node `n` in `T1` such
that the subtree of `n` is identical to `T2`. That is, if you cut off
the tree at node `n`, the two trees would be identical.
